4. Ma3loma (Reddit Clone): 
   - Architected a RESTful API using Express.js and React, managed a MongoDB Atlas database, and deployed a containerized microservices architecture utilizing the Google Gemini API.

5. FOS Operating System: 
   - Implemented virtual memory management in a custom OS kernel, including paging, page fault handling, and dynamic memory allocation in C.

6. Social Network System: 
   - Developed a graph-based platform in C++ supporting user management and a friend suggestion algorithm using BFS traversal up to 4 degrees of separation.

--- Personal Interests & Goals ---
I am deeply passionate about advancing my knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and image processing. My professional goal is to collaborate on open-source Data Science projects and build scalable, AI-driven web applications. 

Outside of software engineering, I have a diverse taste in media and entertainment. I am an avid listener of 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Rock music. I also enjoy watching mafia movies set in NYC. For relaxation, I am a fan of TV shows like "The Amazing World of Gumball", "SpongBob" and "How I Met Your Mother".
